# Multiplayer-Prototype
3D movement, object sync over network. More to come.

## What's this?

This is a prototype project that I use for developing different C# scripts for a 3D optionally-multiplayer game. The main idea is to make a system of easily editable, pluggable classes, corresponding to different tasks. E.g. a character motor with a base state,  additional states can be created for different needs, that can be coupled with any object in the game that has a CharacterContoller:Unity on it.

### Disclaimer
This uses a free PUN version with total player limit of 20, across the globe. I'd recommend not touching it until I buy a proper CCU plan.

### License
If you want to use the code in your app, hire me instead. If you want to watch and learn, feel free to do it. And please, at least change variable names if you decide to steal it. Because if I somehow find out that you're selling my work or using it in your application without my explicit permission, I will find you and you will fucking pay for that, capisci? This is basically an equivalent of CC BY-NC-ND 4.0, but you can use this if you get my explicit permission to do so.
