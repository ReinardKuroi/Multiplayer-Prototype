# Multiplayer-Prototype
3D movement, object sync over network. More to come.

## What's this?

This is a prototype project that I use for developing different C# scripts for a 3D optionally-multiplayer game. The main idea is to make a system of easily editable, pluggable classes, corresponding to different tasks. E.g. a character motor with a base state,  additional states can be created for different needs, that can be coupled with any object in the game that has a CharacterContoller:Unity on it.

### Disclaimer
This uses a free PUN version with total player limit of 20, across the globe. I'd recommend not touching it until I buy a proper CCU plan.
